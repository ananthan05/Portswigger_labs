## Solution :

So event handlers and `href` attribute are blacklisted.

Letâ€™s use Burp intruder to see whether we have any tags that we can use.

Now Visit the  [XSS cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) and click "Copy tags to clipboard".

In Burp Intruder, in the Payloads tab, click "Paste" to paste the list of tags into the payloads list. Click "Start attack".

When the attack is finished, review the results.

Valid tags:

```
<a>
<animate>
<image>
<svg>
<title>
```

>
>Note that you need to label your vector with the word "Click" in order to induce the simulated lab user to click your vector. For example:

```html
<a href="">Click me</a>
```
but this is blocked we have to some inject alert using the valid tags.

our normal payload is this.

```html
<a href="javascript:alert()>Click me</a>
```
 > scince this payload is not accepeted. we will create this payload using  Some of the whitelisted tags are `svg`, `animate` and `a`. We can use them to our advantage and easily trigger our javascript.

for refernce how animate tag works.

So our payload will be

```html
<svg>
 <a>
  <animate attributeName="href" values="javascript:alert()"></animate>
   <text x="20" y="20">Click me</text>
 </a>
</svg>
```

Give the payload in search.

By pressing `click me` an alert pop will come.
